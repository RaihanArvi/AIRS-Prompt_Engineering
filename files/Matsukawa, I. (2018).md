This article uses hourly data on household usage of an in-home display (IHD) in a randomized field experimentto investigate how acquiring information from IHDs affects electricity usage of households. Providing IHDs, which enables households to see a graph of their half-hourly electricity consumption in real time, is a promising policy intervention that corrects for biases associated with inattention and limited information-processing capacity by promoting salience and learning. The immediate effect of providing an IHD is heightened household attention to information on consumption, and the repetition of attention is expected to improve households' capacity to process information.

The estimation results of a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of hourly IHD usage and continuous hourly consumption of electricity of 501 households living in a southern area of Kyoto, Japan, over 36 days in summer 2012 provide evidence on the effects of real-time information feedback over time. The cumulative usage of IHDs reduced hourly electricity consumption of "energy-using" households whose electricity consumption before the experiment had been far higher than other households. Contrary to the energy-conservation literature, the cumulative usage of IHDs raised electricity consumption of "energy-saving" households whose electricity consumption had been relatively modest before the experiment. This may be due to a "boomerang effect," which raised electricity usage of well-informed households whose electricity saving had exceeded the optimal saving before obtaining information about their actual usage.

## **1. Introduction**

Inattention and limited information-processing capacity are among the key factors in consumption deviations from full optimization, which requires consumers to perfectly recognize and attain their optimal choice of goods and services by making full use of available information about price, quantity, quality, and other product attributes. Inattention could lead to suboptimal consumption choices regardless of the individual's information-processing capacity ([DellaVigna,](#page-17-0) [2009\).](#page-17-0) Individuals with limited capacity could make mistakes in choosing their optimal consumption even when fully informed [\(de](#page-18-0) [Palma](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [1994\).](#page-18-0) Under these circumstances, deviations from full consumption optimization reduce social welfare, making policy interventions necessary to increase attention and information-processing capacity.

This article focuses on the policy interventions that correctfor consumption biases associated with inattention and limited capacity by providing real-time information feedback via an in-home display (IHD) to households. Real-time information feedback provided via an IHD is expected to decrease the difference between the optimal and actual levels of electric-

ity demand by increasing households' attention. Because of learning over time, the repetition of attention may improve households' capacity to process information about electricity usage.

I investigate how information acquisition affects households' consumption of electricity, which has not been explicitly analyzed in the empirical literature on the effects of real-time information feedback [\(Sexton](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [1989;](#page-18-0) [Matsukawa,](#page-18-0) [2004;](#page-18-0) [Abrahamse](#page-17-0) et [al.,](#page-17-0) [2005;](#page-17-0) [Darby,](#page-17-0) [2006;](#page-17-0) [Houde](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2013;](#page-18-0) [Attari](#page-17-0) et [al.,](#page-17-0) [2014;](#page-17-0) [Jessoe](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [Rapson,](#page-18-0) [2014;](#page-18-0) [Lynham](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2016;](#page-18-0) [Qiu](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2017\).](#page-18-0) The previous literature focuses on the presence of real-time information feedback, but not on how much information households obtain from the feedback. Information acquisition produces a more precise mapping of how consumption alternatives affect outcomes in the decision-making process ([Simon,](#page-18-0) [1955;](#page-18-0) [Gabaix](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2006\).](#page-18-0) Information acquisition is crucial for estimating the effects of real-time information feedback, because inattention and limited information-processing capacity depend on how much households acquire available information. All else being equal, the more information households acquire, the more attention and capacity they achieve.

I measure the effects of information acquisition on households' usage of electricity using hourly data on whether households used IHDs in a randomized field experiment. This experiment corresponds to a "framed field experiment," which typically uses experimental participants from the market of interest and incorporate important elements within the context of the naturally occurring environment with respect to the commodity, task, stakes, and information set of the subjects [\(List](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [Price,](#page-18-0) [2013\).](#page-18-0) The households could consult a graph of their half-hourly electricity consumption in real time on a tablet display at any time during the experiment. Electronic devices installed on the premises automatically recorded whether households used IHDs each hour during the experiment. It is difficult to ensure that households using many electric appliances with different consumption levels attain a satisfactory level of electricity consumption. Access to the electricity information in the graph enables households to raise their attention and information-processing capacity. The welfare impact ofthe policy intervention that provides households with IHDs depends on how much information households acquire by using their IHDs and could be measured as the incremental benefit reaped from the choice of a more satisfactory level of electricity consumption.

The estimation results of a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of hourly IHD usage and continuous hourly consumption of electricity of 501 households over 36 days in the experiment provide evidence on the effects of real-time information feedback over time. While the cumulative usage of IHDs reduced hourly electricity consumption of "energyusing" households whose electricity consumption before the experiment had been far higher than other households, it raised that of "energy-saving" households whose pre-experiment electricity consumption was relatively modest. The empirical evidence in this article provides an important policy implication: providing households with IHDs could adversely affect their energy conservation. This may occur because a "boomerang effect" raised electricity usage of well-informed households whose electricity saving had exceeded the optimal saving before obtaining information about their actual usage [\(Schultz](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2007;](#page-18-0) [Ayres](#page-17-0) et [al.,](#page-17-0) [2009\).](#page-17-0) The article thus contrasts with the earlier finding on IHDs' energy-saving effects on household electricity consumption [\(Sexton](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [1989;](#page-18-0) [Matsukawa,](#page-18-0) [2004;](#page-18-0) [Abrahamse](#page-17-0) et [al.,](#page-17-0) [2005;](#page-17-0) [Darby,](#page-17-0) [2006;](#page-17-0) [Houde](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2013;](#page-18-0) [Attari](#page-17-0) et [al.,](#page-17-0) [2014;](#page-17-0) [Lynham](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2016\).](#page-18-0)

Apartfrom the electricity industry,this article's model of consumption salience and learning with information acquisition could be applied to industries where each household contracts with a single supplier for the use of multiple units of products, such as the gas, water, telecommunications, and Internet services sectors. In these industries, consumers often use multiple units of appliances, such as heating and cooking for gas, the kitchen and bath for water, cellular phones for telecommunications, and tablet computers for Internet services. Providing information about consumption assists consumers in closing the gap between their actual and optimal consumption in these industries, and the effects of salience and learning are expected to correct for biased beliefs about consumption.

The rest of this article proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains the design of the experiment on IHD provision and the evidence on the randomization of the experiment. Section [3](#page-5-0) presents a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of hourly IHD usage and continuous hourly consumption of electricity. Section [4](#page-7-0) describes the hourly data obtained from the experiment and discusses stylized facts on information acquisition and electricity consumption. Section [5](#page-8-0) presents the estimation results of the model, and the policy implications of the empirical findings. Section [6](#page-13-0) concludes this article. The [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A](#page-13-0) provides additional information on the experiment and estimation results.

## **2. Experimental design**

In summer 2012, the Keihanna Eco-City Next-Generation Energy and Social Systems Demonstration Project Promotion Council (hereafter, referred to as the Keihanna Eco-City Promotion Council) conducted an experiment in which households in a southern area of Kyoto, Japan, were assigned to either control or treatment groups. The experiment was implemented on weekdays during July 23 to September 13 in 2012 (36 days). An IHD was provided free of charge to households assigned to the treatment group. The control group households did not have IHDs. The area's climate during experimentation was hot and humid, the maximum ambient temperature often exceeding 30 ◦ Celsius as shown in [Fig.](#page-16-0) A1 in the [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A.](#page-13-0)

## 2.1. IHDs and information provision

The households in the treatment could see a graph of their half-hourly electricity consumption in real time on a tablet display at any time during the experiment. The information feedback about the half-hourly usage of electricity in this article

Image /page/2/Figure/1 description: The image shows a graph of half-hourly electricity consumption of a household in a tablet display. The graph shows electricity usage status as of Thursday, July 25, 2013. The amount of electricity used on this day is 761 kWh. The graph also shows electricity usage during the time period when the electricity charge rate is particularly high. For summer, from 13:00 to 16:00, the electricity usage is 1.36kWh. For winter, from 18:00 to 21:00, the electricity usage is not specified. The x-axis of the graph represents time, ranging from 0 to 23 hours. The y-axis represents kWh, ranging from 0 to 0.6. The graph shows the amount of electricity used on Wednesday, July 24, and the amount of electricity used on Thursday, July 25. There is also a text box that says "Amount of electricity used from 13:00 to 13:30: 0.27kWh".

is closer to that provided in real-time usage than the feedback technologies employed in previous field experiments [\(Sexton](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [1989;](#page-18-0) [Matsukawa,](#page-18-0) [2004\).](#page-18-0) However, the interval of information feedback in this article is a little longer than the 10-min interval in [Houde](#page-18-0) et [al.](#page-18-0) [\(2013\)](#page-18-0) and the 15-min interval in [Jessoe](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [Rapson](#page-18-0) [\(2014\).](#page-18-0)

Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the graph in the tablet display: each bar indicates the half-hourly electricity consumption on July 25, and the solid line with dots indicates the electricity consumption on the day before. The latest information on the half-hourly consumption of electricity indicates 0.27 kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is displayed in the middle of the graph in Fig. 1. The peak period is indicated by the shaded areas. The peak period was from 1 PM to 4 PM in summer. A comparison of electricity consumption between one day and a day in the previous week could be made by touching the area labeled "Comparison with previous week" in the tablet display.

The use of IHDs is defined by whether each household accessed to the graph illustrated in Fig. 1 each hour. The hourly access to an IHD was recorded whenever each household accessed to a graph in Fig. 1 by operating the IHD. Although households could see other information items through IHDs such as the amount of electronic points associated with electricity consumption during peak hours (discussed later in Section 2.2), their access to these information items was not included in the use of IHDs.

The data on the half-hourly consumption of electricity were updated in real time by an electronic device installed in each household. Households could acquire information about which appliances were most frequently used by viewing the realtime usage of electricity in the IHDs without incurring information acquisition costs. Prior to the first experiment, engineers of the Keihanna Eco-City Promotion Council visited each household to ensure that the tablet display worked properly and that the household could use it fully.

## 2.2. Pecuniary incentives for electricity saving during peak hours

In addition to the IHDs, a policy intervention using pecuniary incentives for reducing electricity usage during peak hours was applied to the treatment group. After the Great Earthquake caused a meltdown ofthe nuclear power plants in Fukushima in March 2011, the Japanese government tightened regulations on nuclear power plant safety. All nuclear power stations stopped operating until they proved that they met the new, much more stringent, safety standards. A serious concern over the supply shortage of electricity has emerged because nuclear power plants supplied approximately one-fourth of the electricity generated in Japan before Fukushima. In response to the critical shortage ofthe supply of power, a field experiment was implemented to examine the effectiveness of pecuniary incentives for electricity savings during peak hours.

Before the experiment, all households in the treatment group received money-convertible electronic points worth 70 US dollars (1 US dollar = 100 yen). The initial amount of the electronic points corresponded to approximately 70% of the monthly average electricity expenditure per Japanese household in 2012 ([EDMC,](#page-18-0) [2014\).](#page-18-0) During the experiment, the more electricity households used during peak hours (i.e., from 1 PM to 4 PM on weekdays), the more points they lost. The lost points are computed as the product of two items: the unit electricity price (cents per kWh) and electricity consumption during peak hours. Thus, households that saved more electricity during peak hours would receive more electronic points as a pecuniary reward for saving electricity at the end of the experiment. If households lost all the points in the middle of the experiment, they had been excluded from the experiment. In fact, there has been no household that lost all the points until the end of the experiment.

The unit electricity price of 40, 60, or 80 cents per kWh was applied to electricity consumption during peak hours on the days when the regional demand for electricity is likely to almost reach the available capacity for electricity supply. These days are often referred to as "critical peak days." In the experiment, a limited number of weekdays were designated as critical peak days and were called on a day-ahead basis. On weekdays not designated as critical peak days, a price of 20 cents per kWh was applied to electricity consumption during the peak hours. The experiment's maximum electricity price of 80 cents per kWh is a little more than three times the average electricity price of 25 cents per kWh for typical Japanese households. This price difference is smaller than that in the literature on critical peak pricing ([Wolak,](#page-18-0) [2011;](#page-18-0) [Faruqui](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2014;](#page-18-0) [Fenrick](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2014;](#page-18-0) [Jessoe](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [Rapson,](#page-18-0) [2014\).](#page-18-0)

There were five critical peak days for each price in the experiment. As shown in [Table](#page-13-0) A1 in the [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A,](#page-13-0) the price applied did not depend on ambient temperature. The critical peak days were randomly selected so that households in the treatment group had not been able to predictthese days prior to notification. The days when the ambienttemperature during peak hours was expected to be below 30 ◦C were excluded from the critical peak days. Because of an error in the prediction of the ambient temperature, the price of 60 cents per kWh was not applied to the days when the ambient temperature during peak hours was 35 ◦C or more.

The unit electricity price of 20 cents per kWh was applied to peak usage on weekdays except for critical peak days. Households in the treatment group had been informed of the maximum number of critical peak days before the experiment began. These households were informed ofthe electricity price at approximately 8 PM the day before each critical peak day by e-mail to their cellular phones and personal computers and on the tablet display during the experiment. A post-experiment survey indicates that almost all households used their cellular phones, personal computers, or tablet displays to confirm which price would be applied to electricity consumption.

## 2.3. Sample construction and tests for randomization

To solicit household participation in the treatment group, the Keihanna Eco-City Promotion Council sent a letter to all households in Kyotanabe City, Kizugawa City, and Seika Town, located in the south of Kyoto, Japan, in January 2012. In the letter, the Council asked these households three questions: whether they had any interest in the experiment, whether they had any access to the Internet, and whether they owned an onsite generation facility, such as a roof-top photovoltaic. Of 39,166 households in the experimental site, 1649 (4.2%) replied and showed a willingness to participate in the experiment. After eliminating households without access to the Internet, those with onsite generation facilities, and the students living alone,the Council randomly selected 500 households and assigned them to the treatment group in February 2012. Ofthe 500 households asked to participate in the treatment group, 375 (75.0%) had agreed to join the experiment by the end of March 2012, and smart meters that measured half-hourly electricity consumption were installed free of charge at their homes by the end of June 2012. The rest refused to participate in the experiment.

Apartfromthe treatment group, 126 control group subjects were randomly selected fromapproximately 3000 households living in the experimental site with a smart meter and owning no facility for onsite generation. The 3000 households were the only households in the experimental site with a smart meter and no self-generation capability. They had a smart meter because the utility randomly chose them and installed it. Unfortunately, no data on the participation rate of the control group are available. Because of a difference in the process used to select households in the treatment and control groups, the participation rate of the control group may have been different from that of the treatment group and selectivity in participation may have occurred in the experiment. If the 375 households that agreed to join the experiment could be systematically different from the rest 125 households as well as the 126 customers in the control group, there exists a potential selection bias in the estimation results.

Two statistical tests for randomization are conducted to examine whether there had been any difference between the control group and the treatment group before the experiment began. First, electricity consumption prior to the experiment is regressed on a dummy variable for the treatment group [\(Delmas](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [Lessem,](#page-18-0) [2014\).](#page-18-0) The daily-average data on household consumption in June 2012 were obtained from the Keihanna Eco-City Promotion Council. The daily-average electricity consumption in June 2012 is regressed on the treatment dummy. Because of one missing observation, the number of households in the treatment group is 374 for the data on electricity consumption in June 2012. [Table](#page-4-0) 1 indicates that the dummy variable was not statistically significant even at the 10% level and F statistic was insignificant. These results support experimental randomness.

Second, experimental randomness is examined by a binary probit model for being assigned to the treatment [\(Houde](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2013\).](#page-18-0) [Table](#page-4-0) 2 presents the estimation results of the binary probit model, in which the dependent variable takes 1 if

households were assigned to the treatment group and 0 otherwise. Daily-average electricity consumption in June 2012 and the dummy for the "all-electric contract" are employed as explanatory variables. The all-electric contract is associated with households using electricity for space heating and cooling, water heating, and cooking. The data on households' electricity contracts were obtained from the Keihanna Eco-City Promotion Council. No household changed electricity contracts during the experiment. The maximum likelihood estimates of the model indicate that no explanatory variable is statistically significant, and the likelihood ratio statistic is insignificant.

The results of these statistical tests in Tables 1 and 2 provide evidence of randomization. In fact, as shown by [Table](#page-14-0) A2 in the [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A,](#page-13-0) there had been no statistically significant difference in daily-average electricity consumption and in the ratio of households' all-electricity contracts between the control and treatment groups prior to the experiment. Furthermore, there seems to be no significant difference in a distribution of the pre-experimental electricity consumption between the two groups, as shown by [Fig.](#page-17-0) A2 in the [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A.](#page-13-0) The evidence of randomization in Tables 1 and 2 implies that the average treatment effect on the treated can be estimated by the difference in the expected outcomes between the treated households and the untreated households [\(Wooldridge,](#page-18-0) [2002\).](#page-18-0)

For the average treatment effect to be properly measured, however, hourly usage of electricity prior to the experiment needs to be comparable between the treatment and control groups. Because of the lack of the data, pre-experimental hourly usage of electricity is assumed to be comparable between the treatment and control groups. This assumption may not hold if the treatment group used electricity more (less) for peak hours and less (more) for off-peak hours than the control group in the pre-experimental periods.

The estimates of the average treatment effect on the treated in this article may imply those of the average effect of the intention to be treated, because the treatment content was delivered by letters and it was not observed whether each household receiving the invitation letter but not participating in the experiment opened the letter ([Hahn](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2016,](#page-18-0) [p.10\).](#page-18-0) Furthermore, because of "site selection bias" [\(Allcott,](#page-17-0) [2015\),](#page-17-0) the response of households in the experiment to the treatment may differ from that of the average household in the Kansai region where the experimental site is located. The site selection bias may arise because a survey on the Kansai region (population approximately 21 million as of October 1, 2014 [\(JSB,](#page-18-0) [2016\)\)](#page-18-0) indicates that households in the treatment group lived with more members than the average household, and were more likely to live in a relatively new detached house that was spacious and equipped with a larger number of air conditioners, as shown in [Table](#page-14-0) A3 in the [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A.](#page-13-0)

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>**3. The model**

## 3.1. A simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of IHD usage and continuous consumption of electricity

A basic assumption of this article is that households' biased beliefs about consumption cause their choice of consumption to deviate from their utility-maximizing consumption. Policy intervention that increases households' attention to their consumption through information provision enables households to lessen their deviation from optimal consumption. This assumption is in line with [Grubb](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [Osborne](#page-18-0) [\(2015\)](#page-18-0) and [Allcott](#page-17-0) et [al.](#page-17-0) [\(2014\).](#page-17-0) Given income and prices that are fully known to household i, the actual consumption of electricity at time t, denoted by KWHi,t, and the decision to use an IHD at time <sup>t</sup>, denoted by ıi,t, are assumed to be described by the following simultaneous equation model:

$$
\frac{KWH_{i,t}}{KWH_{i,t}^*} = (1 + S_{i,t-1} + \delta_{i,t})^{\lambda} \exp(\gamma_1 L_{i,t} + Y_{i,t}\zeta + e_{1,i,t}),

The optimal, utility-maximizing electricity consumption for household i at time t, denoted by KWH\* i,t, is assumed to <sup>a</sup> function of Zi,t, which denotes <sup>a</sup> vector of exogenous variables including income and prices. The effects of these variables are denoted by , <sup>a</sup> vector of parameters. The term <sup>1</sup> <sup>+</sup> <sup>S</sup>i,t -1 <sup>+</sup> ıi,t on the right-hand side of Eqs. (1) and (3) indicates how much information on electricity consumption household i has acquired until time t from the cumulative usage of an IHD over time. This term remains unity as long as households never use IHDs. An unobserved latent variable Li,t determines ıi,t and is assumed to be a function of the natural log of actual electricity consumption, a vector of exogenous variables (X2,i,t), the natural log of the term 1 + Si,t -1 <sup>+</sup> ıi,t, and the error term <sup>e</sup>2,i,t. The ratio of the actual to optimal electricity consumption is assumed to be a function of Li,t, <sup>a</sup> vector of exogenous variables (Yi,t), the term <sup>1</sup> <sup>+</sup> <sup>S</sup>i,t -1 <sup>+</sup> ıi,t, and the error term <sup>e</sup>1,i,t. <sup>2</sup> and are vectors of parameters, and <sup>ˇ</sup>, 1, and <sup>2</sup> are parameters.

The effect ofIHD use is indicatedbyparameter-, whichispositive ifhouseholdi's biasedbeliefs about electricity consumption lead to under-consumption (i.e., KWHi,t <sup>&</sup>lt; KWH\* i,t), and negative ifthey lead to over-consumption (i.e., KWHi,t <sup>&</sup>gt; KWH\* i,t). If biased beliefs lead to under-consumption (over-consumption), then increasing attention through information acquisition raises (reduces) consumption (i.e., - <sup>&</sup>gt; <sup>0</sup> [- < 0]). The cumulative use of IHDs over time is expected to improve households' capacity to process information because households could learn about how to reduce the difference between actual and optimal consumption from their experience of adjusting consumption.

A simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of IHD usage and continuous consumption of electricity is assumed in Eqs. (1)–(3), because of a bilateral relationship between IHD use and electricity consumption. While households may use IHDs first and then determine their usage of electricity to achieve the targeted usage, they may determine electricity usage first and then check IHDs to see if they attain the targeted usage. For instance, other things being equal, households consuming more electricity because of owning the larger number of electric appliances may be more likely to check IHDs while those consuming less electricity because of being out of home longer may be less likely to check IHDs. Thus, for the effects of IHD use on electricity consumption to be identified, it is necessary to employ a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of IHD usage and continuous consumption of electricity.

## 3.2. Econometric specification

The effects of IHD usage on electricity consumption are estimated using a set of reduced-form equations of households' hourly choices of IHD use and electricity. After inserting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), taking natural logs on both sides of Eq. (1) yields the following equation:

$$
logKWH_{i,t} = X_{1,i,t}\alpha_1 + \lambda \log(1 + S_{i,t-1} + \delta_{i,t}) + \gamma_1 L_{i,t} + e_{1,i,t},
$$
\n(4)

where <sup>a</sup> vector of exogenous variables, <sup>X</sup>1,i,t, consists of <sup>Y</sup>i,t and <sup>Z</sup>i,t and <sup>1</sup> is <sup>a</sup> vector of parameters. The error terms <sup>e</sup>1,i,t in Eq. (4) and e2,i,t in Eq. (3) are assumed to be jointly normally distributed, with mean vector zero and covariance matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_1^2 & \sigma_{1,2} \\ \sigma_{1,2} & \sigma_2^2 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

<span id="page-6-0"></span>The condition ˇ <sup>+</sup> -<sup>2</sup> <sup>=</sup> <sup>0</sup> is <sup>a</sup> necessary and sufficient condition for the model of Eqs.[\(3\)](#page-5-0) and [\(4\)to](#page-5-0) be identified [\(Heckman,](#page-18-0) [1978,](#page-18-0) [p.936\).](#page-18-0) With the condition ˇ <sup>+</sup> -<sup>2</sup> <sup>=</sup> <sup>0</sup> imposed, equation system consisting of Eqs.[\(3\)](#page-5-0) and [\(4\)](#page-5-0) can be written in reduced form as

where

$$
\pi_{1,1} = \alpha_1/(1-\gamma_1\gamma_2), \pi_{2,2} = \alpha_2/(1-\gamma_1\gamma_2), \pi_{2,1} = \alpha_1\gamma_2/(1-\gamma_1\gamma_2),
$$

$$
\pi_{1,2} = \alpha_2 \gamma_1 / (1 - \gamma_1 \gamma_2), \pi_{1,3} = (\lambda + \gamma_1 \beta) / (1 - \gamma_1 \gamma_2),
$$

$$
\varepsilon_{1,i,t} = (e_{1,i,t} + \gamma_1 e_{2,i,t})/(1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2), \text{ and } \varepsilon_{2,i,t} = (e_{2,i,t} + \gamma_2 e_{1,i,t})/(1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2).
$$

Random variables <sup>ε</sup>1,i,t and <sup>ε</sup>2,i,t are assumed to be jointly normally distributed, with mean vector zero and covariance matrix

\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1^2 & \omega_{1,2} \\ \omega_{1,2} & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Because the variable ıi,t is endogenous and correlated with the error term <sup>ε</sup>1,i,t, the estimates of Eq. (5) are biased. To correct for the endogeneity bias, a two-step estimation procedure proposed by Heckman (1978, p.938) is applied to the equation system consisting of Eqs. (5) and (6). First, the binary probit model specified by Eq. (6) is estimated. Then, using the parameter estimates of the binary probit model, the estimate of the inverse Mills ratio, denoted by Mi,t, is computed for the treatment group as

$$
M_{i,t} = \frac{\phi(X_{1,i,t}\overline{\pi_{2,1}} + X_{2,i,t}\overline{\pi_{2,2}})}{\phi(X_{1,i,t}\overline{\pi_{2,1}} + X_{2,i,t}\overline{\pi_{2,2}})} \quad \text{if } \delta_{i,t} = 1,
$$
  
$$
M_{i,t} = \frac{-\phi(X_{1,i,t}\overline{\pi_{2,1}} + X_{2,i,t}\overline{\pi_{2,2}})}{[1 - \phi(X_{1,i,t}\overline{\pi_{2,1}} + X_{2,i,t}\overline{\pi_{2,2}})]} \quad \text{if } \delta_{i,t} = 0,
$$
 (7)

where <sup>ϕ</sup>(.) is the standard normal probability density function, ˚(.) is the corresponding cumulative function, and m,n <sup>ˆ</sup> is the consistent estimate of m,n. By including the estimates ofthe inverse Mills ratio for the treatment group, Eq.(5) becomes:

$$
logKWH_{i,t} = X_{1,i,t}\pi_{1,1} + X_{2,i,t}\pi_{1,2} + \pi_{1,3}\log(1 + S_{i,t-1} + \delta_{i,t}) - \omega_{1,2}M_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{1,i,t}.
$$
\n(8)

The hourly electricity consumption model in Eq.(8)is estimated atthe second step. The estimates of Eq.(8) are consistent, because the term <sup>ω</sup>1,2Mi,t corrects for the endogeneity bias associated with the possible correlation between ıi,t and <sup>ε</sup>1,i,t. The consistent estimate of parameter is obtained directly from the estimate of 1,3 in Eq. (8), using 1,3 <sup>=</sup> (- <sup>+</sup> 1ˇ)/(1 <sup>−</sup> 12) and the condition <sup>ˇ</sup> <sup>+</sup> -<sup>2</sup> <sup>=</sup> 0. Note that neither <sup>1</sup> nor <sup>2</sup> could be identified, because it is difficult to determine whether each exogenous variable belongs to X1,i,t or X2,i,t.

A fixed effects model is used to estimate the binary probit model of hourly IHD use in Eq. (6) and the hourly electricity consumption model in Eq.(8), because ofthe lack of data on demographic and housing characteristics, income, and appliance ownership. Specifically, the following models are estimated:

$$
L_{i,t} = \xi_i + \Sigma_{k=2}^{24} a_k^L H O U R_{k,t} + \Sigma_{k=2}^{36} b_k^L D A T E_{k,t} + \Sigma_{k=1}^4 c_k^L D_{k,i,t} + \varepsilon_{2,i,t},\tag{9}
$$

$$
\log KWH_{i,t} = \nu_i + \Sigma_{k=2}^{24} a_k^W HOUR_{k,t} + \Sigma_{k=2}^{36} b_k^W DATE_{k,t} + \Sigma_{k=1}^4 c_k^W D_{k,i,t} + \pi_{1,3} \log \left( 1 + S_{i,t-1} + \delta_{i,t} \right) - \omega_{1,2} M_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{1,i,t},
$$

DATEk,t: dummy variable equal to <sup>1</sup> if time <sup>t</sup> corresponds to <sup>k</sup>th date,

Dk,i,t: dummy variable equal to <sup>1</sup> if the <sup>k</sup>th unit electricity price is applied to household <sup>i</sup> at time <sup>t</sup>, and

<sup>i</sup>, <sup>v</sup>i: household fixed effects.

Dummy variables associated with pecuniary incentives for reducing electricity usage during peak hours are observed exogenous factors affecting both IHD use and electricity consumption. Each dummy variable, <sup>D</sup>1,i,t, <sup>D</sup>2,i,t, <sup>D</sup>3,i,t, or <sup>D</sup>4,i,t, is equal to 1 only when an electricity price of 20, 40, 60, or 80 cents per kWh was applied to household i at time t. The effects of dummy variables associated with hours and dates include those of weather conditions on IHD use and electricity consumption.

The household fixed effects, <sup>i</sup> and <sup>v</sup>i, include those of demographic and housing characteristics, income, and appliance ownership on IHD use and electricity consumption. A random effects model is also estimated as an alternative specification of Eq. (10). However, because the number of time periods is large (i.e., 864 periods), a random-effects probit model cannot

The treatment group's consumption is represented by a dotted line with square markers, while the control group's consumption is represented by a solid line with circular markers. A shaded area spans from hour 13 to hour 16. The control group's electricity consumption starts at approximately 0.59 kWh at hour 1, dips to around 0.49 kWh at hour 2, rises to about 0.74 kWh at hour 4, then decreases to approximately 0.48 kWh at hour 7, and gradually increases to around 0.60 kWh at hour 13. It remains relatively stable at 0.60 kWh until hour 16, then rises sharply to about 0.88 kWh at hour 20, before decreasing to approximately 0.69 kWh at hour 24.

Note that the incidental parameters problem associated with a fixed-effects probit model does not arise here because of a sufficiently large number of time periods ([Greene,](#page-18-0) [2008,](#page-18-0) [p.](#page-18-0) [801\).](#page-18-0)

## **4. Data**

The data used for empirical analysis were obtained from the Keinanna Eco-City Promotion Council. These data include hourly household electricity consumption, discrete choice of hourly household usage of IHDs, daily-average household electricity consumption in June 2012, and electricity contracts during the experiment. Household consumption of electricity was recorded for every half-hour during the experiment by a smart meter installed free of charge in the households. The Keinanna Eco-City Promotion Council also collected data on whether each household used an IHD every hour during the experiment. These data were automatically recorded by an electronic device installed in each household. The half-hourly data on the electricity consumption of each household were aggregated into the hourly data because the data on whether households used IHDs were recorded only on an hourly basis.

Fig. 2 compares the average hourly electricity consumption of the treatment group with that of the control group during the experiment. The impact of IHD provision is also shown by [Table](#page-14-0) A4 in the Appendix which compares the hourly electricity consumption averaged over the 36 days of the experiment between the control and treatment groups. During the peak hours (i.e., from 1 PM to 4 PM), the electricity consumption of the treatment group was lower than that of the control group by approximately 0.15 kWh or 25% of the average hourly consumption of electricity. This difference arises because of pecuniary incentives for reducing electricity consumption during peak hours. For the rest of hours, electricity consumption of the treatment group was slightly lower than that of the control group. As shown by [Table](#page-14-0) A2 in the [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A,](#page-13-0) on average, there is a slight difference in hourly electricity consumption between these two groups during the experiment. This difference, which is found to be statistically insignificant in [Table](#page-14-0) A2, is approximately 0.05 kWh or 8% of the hourly average consumption of the control group.

[Fig.](#page-8-0) 3 presents the proportion of households using IHDs to the treatment group by hour of the day during the experiment. On average, approximately 6.2% of the treated households used IHDs each hour during the experiment. The proportion of households using IHDs was relatively high in the morning (approximately 7–8%) and evening (approximately 9–11%) when household members are likely to be present at home. This implies that the use of IHDs depends on the presence of household members, which also affects electricity consumption. [Fig.](#page-8-0) 4 shows the average cumulative use of an IHD at the end of each day during the experiment. On average, the cumulative use of an IHD amounts to approximately 77 times at the end of the experiment, implying approximately 2.1 times of IHD use per day for the average household.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>Image /page/8/Figure/1 description: The image is a line graph that shows the proportion of households using IHDs averaged over the 36 days of the experiment. The x-axis represents the hour of the day, ranging from 1 to 24. The y-axis represents the proportion of households using IHDs, ranging from 0.0% to 12.0%. The line graph shows that the proportion of households using IHDs is lowest in the early morning hours (around 0.0%-2.0%), increases in the morning to around 8.0%, decreases slightly in the afternoon to around 6.0%, and then increases sharply in the evening to around 11.0%. The proportion of households using IHDs then decreases slightly in the late evening hours to around 7.0%.

## **5. Estimation results**

## 5.1. IHD equation

[Table](#page-9-0) 3 presents the estimation results of the fixed-effects binary probit model for the hourly usage of IHDs in Eq. [\(9\).](#page-6-0) A random-effects probit model cannot be estimated because of the large number of time periods (i.e., 864 periods) ([Greene,](#page-18-0) [2012,](#page-18-0) [E-633\).](#page-18-0) The maximum likelihood method was employed to estimate parameters in the model based on the panel data of 864 time periods (i.e., 24 h by 36 days) and 375 households of the treatment group. Hourly and date dummy variables, which are not listed in the table, are included in the estimation of the model. A likelihood ratio test statistic distributing Chi-squared indicates the validity of the model as this statistic is significant at the 1% level. Although the model correctly predicts 93.8% of the observations, McFadden's likelihood ratio index is relatively low (i.e., 0.102).

The dummy variables for all levels of electricity prices associated with the peak-reducing incentives exhibit positive coefficients that are statistically significant at either the 1% or 5% level in [Table](#page-9-0) 3. The marginal effects of these dummy variables range from 0.008 to 0.014. The marginal effect of the dummy variable is the largest for D2,i,t = 1 (i.e., the price of 40 cents per kWh is applied) while it is the smallest for D3,i,t = 1 (i.e., the price of 60 cents per kWh is applied). These results imply that although pecuniary incentives for reducing electricity consumption during peak hours encourage households to use IHDs, raising the level of these incentives does not necessarily promote the use of IHDs.

Table 4 presents the estimation results of the hourly electricity consumption model in Eq. [\(10\)](#page-6-0) based on the panel data of 864 time periods (i.e., 24 h by 36 days) and 501 households of both the treatment and control groups. Standard errors are clustered at the household level to correct for serial correlation in the electricity consumption of each household in Eq. [\(10\).](#page-6-0) The estimated coefficients of the fixed-effects binary probit model in Section [5.1](#page-8-0) are used to compute the inverse Mills ratio, Mi,t, in Eq. [\(7\).](#page-6-0) Hourly and date dummy variables, which are not listed in the table, are included in the estimation of the model.

The positive coefficient ofthe variable log(1 + Si,t -1 <sup>+</sup> ıi,t)indicates that without pecuniary incentives for reducing electricity usage during peak hours, cumulative usage of IHDs over time would raise electricity consumption, an effect statistically significant at the 5% level for both the fixed and random effects models. The coefficients of the variable log(1 + Si,t -1 <sup>+</sup> ıi,t) in both the fixed and random effects models indicate the elasticities of the actual electricity consumption with respect to the cumulative IHD usage. These elasticities are small: given the optimal electricity consumption and the term exp(<sup>1</sup> <sup>L</sup>i,t <sup>+</sup> <sup>Y</sup>i,t - + e1,i,t) in Eq. [\(1\),](#page-5-0) a 100% increase in the cumulative usage of IHDs raises the actual consumption of electricity, which was lower than the optimal electricity consumption (i.e., KWHi,t <sup>&</sup>lt; KWH\* i,t), by approximately 0.4%. These results imply that information acquisition through the use of an IHD affects electricity consumption by raising attention and learning over time.1

The finding on the energy-using effect of households' IHD usage contrasts with the previous finding on the energyconservation effect of the presence of an IHD ([Sexton](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [1989;](#page-18-0) [Matsukawa,](#page-18-0) [2004;](#page-18-0) [Abrahamse](#page-17-0) et [al.,](#page-17-0) [2005;](#page-17-0) [Darby,](#page-17-0) [2006;](#page-17-0) [Houde](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2013;](#page-18-0) [Attari](#page-17-0) et [al.,](#page-17-0) [2014;](#page-17-0) [Lynham](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2016\).2](#page-18-0) A couple of explanations for this difference in an IHD's effect on electricity consumption are possible. First, this study's model for household electricity consumption explicitly includes the effect of information acquisition, which has not been investigated in the literature that focuses on the presence of an IHD. For example, Houde et al. (2013) indicate that the presence of a real-time feedback technology yielded reductions in residential electricity consumption an average of 5.7%. Houde et al. (2013), however, did not take account of significant heterogeneity in the treatment effect regarding how much households actually used IHDs. Information acquisition through IHD use should be investigated rather than the presence of IHDs because the difference in the frequency of IHD usage across households affects electricity consumption.

Second, a "boomerang effect" of IHD use may occur among households that had already reduced electricity usage more than they had planned before starting IHD use [\(Schultz](#page-18-0) et [al.,](#page-18-0) [2007;](#page-18-0) [Ayres](#page-17-0) et [al.,](#page-17-0) [2009\).](#page-17-0) In the wake of the nuclear accident in Fukushima, many have been deeply concerned about the security of Japan's electricity supply. This concern may have motivated Japanese households to save electricity. In fact, according to a survey by the Keihanna Eco-City Promotion Council, approximately 4500 out of 9000 households in the Kansai region undertook activities in 2012 that conserved energy in response to rising concern about the electricity supply. As a result, Kansai households achieved an approximately 10% reduction in the peak electricity consumption in the summer of 2012 ([JMETI,](#page-18-0) [2012\).](#page-18-0) Without IHDs, these households could not have realized how much electricity consumption they had reduced and they may have reduced their consumption more than they had targeted. This may have led to under-consumption of electricity prior to the experiment. Because of underconsumption, providing Kansai households with IHDs would have raised their electricity usage by letting them be aware of excessive electricity saving and increase their consumption of electricity to achieve the conservation targets.

The possibility that respondents in the experiment had been highly motivated by rising concern about the electricity supply prior to the experiment may make it difficultto generalize the results ofthis article. However, as in the 1970s oil shocks and California's electricity crisis, markets for energy often experience shocks that require rapid changes in consumption, and how energy consumption responds to policy interventions becomes crucial ([Reiss](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [White,](#page-18-0) [2008\).](#page-18-0) This article provides unique evidence on how residential electricity consumption responds to IHD provision when market shocks occur.

Even if IHDs were not available, the information about monthly electricity bills may have enabled households to adjust their electricity consumption. In fact, the literature provides evidence that increased (decreased) attention to electricity bills reduced (raised) residential electricity usage [\(Gilbert](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [Graff](#page-18-0) [Zivin,](#page-18-0) [2013;](#page-18-0) [Sexton,](#page-18-0) [2015\).](#page-18-0) However, the literature did not investigate to what extent households actually referred to the information about their bills. Also, monthly electricity bills make it difficult for households to realize their hourly usage of electricity, which could be provided by IHDs.

Turning to pecuniary incentives for reducing electricity usage during peak hours, the dummy variables for all levels of electricity prices exhibit negative coefficients that are statistically significant at the 1% level for both the fixed and random effects models in [Table](#page-9-0) 4. Without any IHD usage, an average energy-saving effect of pecuniary incentives on peak-time consumption would range from 12.9% to 23.9%. These effects are close to those in [Faruqui](#page-18-0) et [al.](#page-18-0) [\(2014\),](#page-18-0) and [Fenrick](#page-18-0) et [al.](#page-18-0) [\(2014\).](#page-18-0)

To examine whether the impact of IHD use on electricity consumption is independent of any pecuniary incentives, I estimate the electricity consumption model using the data only for off-peak hours. The estimation result is summarized in [Table](#page-16-0) A8 in the [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A.](#page-13-0) The impact of the cumulative usage of IHDs on electricity consumption in [Table](#page-16-0) A8 is similar to the one reported in [Table](#page-9-0) 4 that uses data for both peak and off-peak hours. Thus, the estimated impacts of IHD use in [Table](#page-9-0) 4 are not a combination of the impacts from IHD and pecuniary incentives.

The learning effects on electricity consumption could be examined by comparing the effects of cumulative usage of IHDs between the first half of the experiment and the entire period of the experiment. To make this comparison, I estimate the electricity consumption model using the data for only the first half of the experiment. The estimation result is summarized in [Table](#page-16-0) A9 in the [Appendix](#page-13-0) [A.](#page-13-0) The impact of the cumulative usage of IHDs was statistically insignificant for the first half of the experiment. This implies that the impact of IHDs depends on learning over relatively a long time period.

The coefficient of the inverse Mills ratio is statistically significant at the 1% level for both the fixed and random effects models in [Table](#page-9-0) 4. The negative coefficient implies that <sup>ω</sup>1,2 is positive and there is <sup>a</sup> positive correlation between the error terms in Eqs. [\(9\)](#page-6-0) and [\(10\).](#page-6-0)

<sup>1</sup> The notification of critical peak days may have an impact on IHD usage and/or energy usage. To examine this impact of notification, I estimate the IHD usage and electricity consumption models by including a dummy for the 8–9 PM interval when notices were issued. Estimation results are summarized in [Tables](#page-15-0) A5 and A6 in the Appendix. The notification of critical peak days had a statistically significant negative impact on hourly electricity consumption while it did not affect IHD usage.

<sup>2</sup> I estimate the electricity usage model with the dummy variable of IHD presence. The estimation result is summarized in [Table](#page-15-0) A7 in the Appendix A. The dummy variable of IHD presence has a statistically significant positive impact on hourly electricity consumption, which is in contrast with the existing literature. This difference may arise because a "boomerang effect" of IHD use may occur among households that had already reduced electricity usage more than they had planned before starting IHD use in this study.

## 5.3. Heterogeneous effects of IHDs across electricity usage

The learning effects of IHD usage, which are found to be energy-using in [Table](#page-9-0) 4 in the last section, may differ across households. The heterogeneity of IHD effects across households, if any, may be relevant to electricity consumption prior to the experiment, because the boomerang effect, which may cause energy-using effects of IHDs, is more relevant to energysaving households than energy-using households. The effects of IHD usage are less likely to be energy-using for households that consumed more electricity before the experiment than those with similar demographic and housing characteristics. Furthermore, the IHD effects could be energy-saving for households that consumed substantial amounts of electricity before the experiment.

To examine whether the learning effects of IHD usage depend on electricity consumption prior to the experiment, the parameter in Eq. [\(1\)](#page-5-0) is assumed to be a linear function of the pre-experiment level of electricity consumption:

$$
\frac{KWH_{i,t}}{KWH_{i,t}^*} = \left(1 + S_{i,t-1} + \delta_{i,t}\right)^{\lambda_0 + \lambda_1 \log(KWH\_pre_i)} \exp\left(\gamma_1 L_{i,t} + Y_{i,t}\zeta + e_{1,i,t}\right),\tag{11}
$$

where KWH prei denotes household <sup>i</sup>'s daily-average electricity consumption in June 2012. With the condition <sup>ˇ</sup> <sup>+</sup> [-<sup>0</sup> <sup>+</sup> -1log(KWH prei)]<sup>2</sup> <sup>=</sup> <sup>0</sup> imposed for each household, the fixed-effects model for hourly electricity consumption can be written as

$$
\log KWH_{i,t} = v_i + \sum_{k=2}^{24} a_k^W H OUR_{k,t} + \sum_{k=2}^{36} b_k^W DATE_{k,t} + \sum_{k=1}^{4} c_k^W D_{k,i,t} + [\pi_{1,3}^0 + \pi_{1,3}^1 \log (KWH, pre_i)] \log(1 + S_{i,t-1} + \delta_{i,t}) - \omega_{1,2} M_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{1,i,t},
$$
(12)

The consistent estimate of parameters -<sup>0</sup> and -<sup>1</sup> are obtained directly from the estimates of <sup>0</sup> <sup>1</sup>,<sup>3</sup> and <sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>,3in Eq. (12), using 0 <sup>1</sup>,<sup>3</sup> <sup>+</sup> <sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>,3log(KWHprei) <sup>=</sup> [<sup>0</sup> <sup>+</sup> 1log(KWHprei) <sup>+</sup> 1ˇ]/(1 <sup>−</sup> 12) and the condition <sup>ˇ</sup> <sup>+</sup> [-<sup>0</sup> <sup>+</sup> -1log(KWH prei)]<sup>2</sup> <sup>=</sup> 0.

Table 5 summarizes the estimation results of Eq. (12). Because of one missing electricity consumption value for June 2012 in the treatment group, the number of households decreased from 501 to 500. For both the fixed and random effects models, <sup>0</sup> <sup>1</sup>,<sup>3</sup> is positive, implying energy-using effects of IHDs. In contrast, the coefficient of the interaction term "log(1 + Si,t -1 <sup>+</sup> ıi,t) <sup>×</sup> log(KWH prei)" is negative (i.e., <sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>,<sup>3</sup> <sup>&</sup>lt; 0) for both models, implying that the learning effects of IHD usage on electricity consumption decrease along with the pre-experiment level of electricity consumption. The coefficient of the interaction term is statistically significant at the 1% level for the fixed-effects model while it is significant at the 10% level for the random-effects model.

The estimation results of Eq. (12) imply the dependence of the learning effects of IHDs on the pre-experiment electricity usage. For example, the estimates of <sup>0</sup> <sup>1</sup>,<sup>3</sup> and <sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>,<sup>3</sup> in the fixed effects model indicate that for households that consumed less than 15.55 kWh per day in June 2012 (i.e., approximately the four-fifths of all households), the energy-using effects of IHDs are dominant. On the contrary, these estimates indicate that the energy-saving effects of IHDs are dominant for households that consumed more than 15.55 kWh per day in June 2012 (i.e., approximately the one-fifth of all households).

The dependence of the learning effects of IHDs on the pre-experiment electricity usage is illustrated by [Figs.](#page-12-0) 5 and 6 where the ratio of the actual to optimal hourly electricity consumption (i.e., KWHi,t/KWH\* i,t) in Eq. (11) is predicted for the

The y-axis represents the ratio, ranging from 0.900 to 0.945, with increments of 0.005. The x-axis represents the date, ranging from 1 to 35, with increments of 2. The line starts at approximately 0.900 on day 1, increases sharply until day 7, and then gradually increases until day 35, where it reaches approximately 0.942.

[\(11\)](#page-11-0) is predicted for the average cumulative IHD usage at the beginning of each day by assuming that (i) the term exp(<sup>1</sup> <sup>L</sup>i,t <sup>+</sup> <sup>Y</sup>i,t - <sup>+</sup> <sup>e</sup>1,i,t) in Eq.

The line starts at approximately 1.100 on day 1 and gradually decreases over time, reaching approximately 1.084 on day 35. The graph illustrates a decreasing trend in the KWH/KWH\* ratio as the date progresses.

Note: The ratio of the actual to optimal hourly electricity consumption (i.e., KWHi,t/KWH\* i,t) in Eq. [\(11\)](#page-11-0) is predicted for the average cumulative IHD usage at the beginning of each day by assuming that (i) the term exp(<sup>1</sup> <sup>L</sup>i,t <sup>+</sup> <sup>Y</sup>i,t - <sup>+</sup> <sup>e</sup>1,i,t) in Eq. [\(11\)](#page-11-0) is 1.100 at each time period, (ii) -<sup>0</sup> and -<sup>1</sup> are the estimates of the fixed effects model in Eq. [\(12\)](#page-11-0) in [Table](#page-11-0) 5, and (iii) the daily-average electricity consumption in June <sup>2012</sup> (i.e., KWH prei) is 21.52 kWh, which corresponds to the median of <sup>a</sup> group of households whose KWH prei lies in the last quintile

average cumulative IHD usage at the beginning of each day (i.e., using an IHD approximately 2.1 times every day during the experiment). In these predictions, during all time periods of the experiment, the term exp(<sup>1</sup> <sup>L</sup>i,t <sup>+</sup> <sup>Y</sup>i,t - + e1,i,t) in Eq. [\(11\)](#page-11-0) is assumed to be 0.900 for the energy-using effects of IHDs and 1.100 for the energy-saving effects of IHDs. This assumption implies that without using IHDs, electricity consumption of energy-saving (using) households would be lower (higher) than the optimal consumption by 10%. The energy-using (saving) effects of IHDs are predicted to correct for the deviations from the optimal consumption of energy-saving (using) households. The estimates of -<sup>0</sup> and -<sup>1</sup> are obtained from those of <sup>0</sup> 1,3 and <sup>1</sup> <sup>1</sup>,<sup>3</sup> of the fixed-effects model in Eq. [\(12\)](#page-11-0) in [Table](#page-11-0) 5. For the energy-using effects of IHDs, the daily-average electricity consumption in June 2012 (i.e., KWH prei) is assumed to be 5.81 kWh, which corresponds to the median of <sup>a</sup> group of households whose KWH prei lies in the first quintile. For the energy-saving effects of IHDs, KWH prei is assumed to be 21.52 kWh, which corresponds to the median of a group of households whose KWH prei lies in the last quintile.

The reduction in the deviations from the optimal electricity consumption by IHD use is predicted to be modest in the illustrative examples, as shown by Figs. 5 and 6. Other things being equal, using an IHD approximately 2.1 times every <span id="page-13-0"></span>day would raise the ratio of the actual to optimal consumption of energy-saving households from 0.900 at the beginning of the experiment to approximately 0.941 at the end of the experiment while it would reduce that ratio for energy-using households from 1.100 at the beginning of the experiment to approximately 1.084 at the end of the experiment.

## **6. Conclusion**

This article uses hourly data on whether each household uses an IHD in a randomized field experiment to investigate how acquiring information from an IHD affects electricity consumption through attention and learning over time. Households in the treatment group could see a graph of their half-hourly electricity consumption in real time with IHDs at any time during the experiment. Providing an IHD is a promising policy intervention that corrects for the consumption biases associated with inattention and limited capacity by promoting attention and learning over time. The immediate effect of providing an IHD is heightened household attention to information on consumption, and the repetition of attention is expected to improve households' capacity to process information.

The estimation results of a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of hourly IHD usage and continuous hourly consumption of electricity indicate statistically significant effects of cumulative usage of IHDs on residential electricity consumption. The increase in IHDs' effects along with households' experience of using IHDs implies that households' capacity to process information could be improved by the repetition of attention to electricity information. The empirical evidence offered by this study also indicates that the effects of the cumulative usage of IHDs on residential electricity consumption depend on the pre-experiment level of electricity consumption. While the cumulative usage of IHDs reduced the electricity consumption of "energy-using" households (i.e., households consuming far more electricity before the experiment than other households), it raised that of "energy-saving" households whose electricity consumption had been relatively modest before the experiment. Thus, providing households with IHDs, which was found to be an effective policy instrument for energy conservation in previous studies, could have an adverse effect on energy conservation.

This article assumes that households' ownership of energy appliances is fixed and does not address how information provision affects households' appliance choices. The empirical literature on energy efficiency has recently investigated the effects of information provision on consumer choices of energy appliances ([Sallee,](#page-18-0) [2013;](#page-18-0) [Davis](#page-17-0) [and](#page-17-0) [Metcalf,](#page-17-0) [2014;](#page-17-0) [Houde,](#page-18-0) [2014;](#page-18-0) [Yeomans](#page-18-0) [and](#page-18-0) [Herberich,](#page-18-0) [2014;](#page-18-0) [Allcott](#page-17-0) [and](#page-17-0) [Taubinsky,](#page-17-0) [2015\).](#page-17-0) Future research in this area could examine the effects of IHDs on the choice of energy appliances and appliances' electricity consumption using data on households' ownership and use of each energy appliance.

<span id="page-17-0"></span>Image /page/17/Figure/1 description: The image shows two histograms comparing electricity consumption. The first histogram, labeled "(a) Control," displays the distribution of electricity consumption in a control group. The x-axis represents electricity consumption in kWh, ranging from approximately 2.5 to 40 kWh. The y-axis represents the frequency or count of households within each consumption range, going up to 15.0. The second histogram, labeled "(b) Treatment," shows the distribution of electricity consumption in a treatment group. The x-axis represents electricity consumption in kWh, ranging from approximately 2.5 to 37.5 kWh. The y-axis represents the frequency or count of households within each consumption range, going up to 45. The caption below the histograms reads, "Fig. A2. Distribution of Household's Daily Average Pre-Experimental Electricity Consumption (kWh) in June 2012."
