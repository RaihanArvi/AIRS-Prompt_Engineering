#### 1. Introduction

#### Smart metering facilitates real-time communication between the customer and the utility company and enhances the potential for detailed historical and comparative consumption feedback for electricity customers. Coupled with an in-house display, households can view their electricity usage in real-time, and track their energy and cost movements with each and every turn of the switch. Such information can help households to understand what activities consume the most, and then to amend their consumption patterns, behaviours and appliance composition to reduce their electricity bill and carbon footprint. In addition, smart meters facilitate the use of time-of-use tariffs which can help reduce peak demand and smooth daily consumption (termed demand response programmes in the literature).1 [1Newsham and Bowker \(2010\)](#page-9-0)

The international roll out of residential smart meters has increased considerably in recent years. The improved consumption feedback provided, and in particular, the installation of in-house displays, has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in some international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions by exploring two research questions. First, does feedback improve a household's stock of information about potential energy reducing behaviours? And second, do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs? Data is from a randomised controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported stocks of information related to energy saving. As with previous results in Ireland, we find that participation in a smart metering programme with time-of-use tariffs significantly reduces demand. Although treated households also increased their selfreported energy-reducing information, such improvements are not correlated with demand reductions in the short-run. Given this result, it is possible that feedback and other information provided in the context of smart metering are mainly effective in reducing and shifting demand because they act as a reminder and motivator.

discuss the main pricing alternatives within demand response trials. These are time-of-use (different tariffs for different times of the day), critical peak (higher prices applied only on pre-advertised 'event days'), real time (tying customer prices to wholesale electricity prices) and peak time rebates (refunds for reaching targets during peak/critical times). Additional demand response can be facilitated by coupling the meter with a number of household appliances (thermostats and air-conditioning units, for example) which respond to peak signals from the meter and/ or to direct signals from the utility company (known as enabling technologies).

Smart metering also provides benefits to other stakeholders of the electricity system. Electricity suppliers and generators benefit from increased grid information and smoother load profiles, both of which improve the operational efficiency and stability of the system [\(Faruqui](#page-9-0) [et al., 2010\)](#page-9-0). The potential to reduce the number and duration of blackouts (through immediate outage detection) is also highlighted by [Krishnamurti et al. \(2012\).](#page-9-0) Nationally, potential reductions in total and peak demand and decreased variability will aid in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, depending on the regulatory framework, the level of carbon tax. For example, [Hledik \(2009\)](#page-9-0) suggests that the roll-out of a smart grid in the US (which has smart metering and time-of-use tariffs at its core) would reduce CO2 emissions by between 5 and 16%.

<sup>1</sup> [Newsham and Bowker \(2010\)](#page-9-0) discuss the main pricing alternatives within demand response trials.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>Quantifying the demand reducing effects of various levels of feedback has been the focus of a large number of studies. [Faruqui et al. \(2010\)](#page-9-0) review the results of 12 separate trials from the US, Canada, Australia and Japan. They find that direct feedback, in the form of an electronic inhouse display (IHD), reduces demand by between 3 and 13% (average 7%). The importance of usability and clarity in such electronic feedback systems has been highlighted in [Stevenson and Rijal \(2010\)](#page-9-0). [Fischer](#page-9-0) [\(2008\)](#page-9-0) summarises the results of twenty-two studies between 1987 and 2006. She concludes that the most effective forms of feedback are provided frequently over a long period of time, give appliance-specific breakdowns of consumption and involve electronic interaction with the households. Although not all the studies in her review show reductions, the typical savings are in the region of 5 to 12%. [Abrahamse et al. \(2005\)](#page-9-0) also emphasise the importance of feedback frequency, but also finds that households responded well to reduction incentives in the form of financial rewards. [Darby \(2010a\),](#page-9-0) in another extensive review of feedback mechanisms, finds that enhanced billing (more frequent and more accurate consumption information) is not always associated with lower demand, and that there is little evidence that written, generalised information (energy-saving tips) has a significant effect. Similar findings are reported by [Ofgem \(2011\),](#page-9-0) where the combination of generalised information and historic feedback is found to be ineffective (in the absence of smart meters). Ofgem, however, do generally find that smart metering supporting by an IHD has a significant reducing effect (around 3%). However, they also find that when the meter is installed as a 'routine replacement' and its presence not communicated effectively to the household there is no significant effect.

For time-of-use pricing, trials have shown large and significant peak reductions. [Faruqui and Sergici \(2011\)](#page-9-0) find that peak-time rebates reduce peak demand by between 18% and 21%, and that adding an 'Energy Orb', which reminds households of peak periods (changes colour depending on the tariff rate applied), increased this reduction to between 23% to 27%. [Ofgem \(2011\)](#page-9-0) also find significant time-of-use pricing effects, but are smaller in magnitude and up to 10%. Two trials summarised by [Faruqui et al. \(2010\)](#page-9-0) find that time-of-use and criticalpeak pricing (in combination with direct feedback (IHD)) reduce peak and critical demand by 5% and 30% respectively. [Newsham and](#page-9-0) [Bowker \(2010\)](#page-9-0) also find similar reductions. Finally, [Faruqui and](#page-9-0) [George \(2005\)](#page-9-0) find that time-of-use rates with a peak to off-peak ratio of two to one produce peak reductions in the region of 5%.

In Ireland, the first major smart meter trial was undertaken between 2009 and 2010 by the Commission for Energy Regulation [\(CER, 2011c](#page-9-0)). The trial simultaneously applied various levels of feedback (more accurate and detailed billing and/or an IHD and generalised information/advice on how to reduce) and time-of-use tariffs to a large and representative sample of Irish households. Overall, treated households reduced their total demand by 2.5% and their peak demand by 8.8%. One interesting finding was that household reductions in peak and overall demand were not significantly different across tariff treatments – households seemed to respond to the presence of a peak/off-peak price differential, but not its magnitude. In contrast, differences were observed in the effects of varying levels of feedback, with households receiving an IHD showing the largest reductions of 3.2% and 11.3% respectively (across all tariff rates).

To date, international trials investigating the effects of smart metering, demand response and enhanced feedback have tended to find that these sorts of measures can reduce residential energy demand, shift use away from peak times and give rise to a range of accompanying benefits for households, utility companies and the environment. However, the mechanisms behind residential demand response behaviour are still not fully understood. Underlying an information-led demand reduction is the notion that increased feedback is correcting a market failure brought about by imperfect information. Prior to smart metering, households were consuming in what was unquestionably an informational void, with little understanding of what appliances and behaviours consume the most, and when. The only feedback available was through the utility bill, which aggregated consumption over lengthy periods, disconnected instantaneous usage and behaviours from cost and often provided inaccurate consumption information due to estimation (bills based on previous readings). Smart metering has the potential to reduce this market failure by taking the imperfectly informed consumer closer to a state of complete consumption information (in the case of real-time electronic feedback). As highlighted by [Gram-Hanssen \(2010\)](#page-9-0), such improvements in knowledge are a key component of bringing about a behavioural change.2 In particular, the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of the inherent value that consumers place on feedback has been recently highlighted in the literature. [Faruqui et al. \(2010\)](#page-9-0) question whether consumers actually use and benefit from this quantitative and qualitative information and incorporate it into their consumption decisions, or if increased feedback simply acts as 'reminders to conserve'. This question is highly relevant for quantifying the effects of feedback in the long term – if it is the latter which is driving reductions, the effect of these reminders may diminish over longer durations and demand reductions could be short-lived.

Whether or not households actually 'learn' something new is the motivation of our first research question – does the increased consumption feedback provided through smart meters lead to improvements in a household's stock of information about how to reduce their electricity use and which appliances consume the most? Our second research question then seeks to quantify the effects of such, if present – do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-ofuse tariffs? These hypotheses are summarised in [Fig. 1.1.](#page-2-0) A direct causal link between stages 1 and 3 is established in the literature, both in Ireland and internationally (for the most part). Significant links between stages 1, 2 and 3 would suggest that imperfect information prior to smart metering was contributing to overconsumption and that this market failure has been addressed by increased consumption feedback. If a link is observed between stages 1 and 2 but not between 2 and 3, informational improvements are not actually an important driver of demand reductions and feedback has reduced demand through some other mechanism. If this is the case, imperfect information, despite being present, was not causing overconsumption and, in short, there was no market failure to correct.

We use a household's self-reported stock of information to investigate the above. We also focus on changes in information rather than the level of information, since such indicators may be more robust to individual differences in reporting behaviour. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 outlines the data employed for this analysis and describes how 'information' change is measured in the surveys. The econometric methods are described in [Sections 3](#page-3-0). [Section 4](#page-4-0) presents the results and [Section 5](#page-8-0) concludes the analysis.

#### 2. Data — the residential smart meter trial

The Irish residential smart meter trial was carried out between 2009 and 2010 and involved the installation of over 5000 smart meters into residential households [\(CER \(2011a\)](#page-9-0) and [CER \(2011c\)\)](#page-9-0).<sup>3</sup> The overall objective of the trial was to test the impact and viability of smart metering technology in Ireland, and to explore the demand reducing effects of various feedback mechanisms and time-of-use tariffs. Recruitment of the nationally representative stratified random sample involved a number of phased postal invitations (five), with each round adding new participants with the goal of increasing the representativeness of the sample (according to location and electricity use).

<sup>2</sup> [Gram-Hanssen \(2010\)](#page-9-0) used Practice Theory to explore how households reduce their standby consumption. The theory shows how technological configurations, routines, knowledge and engagement interact to bring about changes in household behaviour.

<sup>3</sup> The overall project commenced in 2007 and was overseen by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) with trials carried out by ESB Networks and Electric Ireland. We are grateful to the Irish Social Science Data Archive (www.ucd.ie/issda/) for providing data.

A benchmark analysis was conducted (July to December 2009) where pre-trial demand data (half-hourly readings) was collected and control/ treatment groups were established.4 During the test period (January to December 2010), treated households received one of three levels of feedback and were assigned to one of four tariff rates. The control group, which also had smart meters installed, did not receive any new information and also had no changes to their usual billing process. In addition to demand data, pre and post-trial surveys were carried out (late 2009 and early 2011 respectively), in which a large amount of household information was collected, including characteristics of the dwelling (including building type and size, appliances use and heating/water systems), demographics and attitudes towards energy use.

Feedback stimuli were applied to households in three treatment groups. All treated households received a new Energy Usage Statement which contained detailed information on the household's electricity use by day of the week, time-of-use and relative to previous bills and other customers, plus more generalised information detailing average appliance consumption levels and tips to lower costs, particularly during peak times.<sup>5</sup> One group (BI-MST henceforth) received just the energy statement on a bimonthly (every two months) basis, while a second group (MST) was billed on a more frequent monthly basis. The third group (IHD) received an electronic in-house display in combination with the bimonthly usage statement.<sup>6</sup> This unit provided real-time consumption, cost and tariff information.

Four time-of-use tariff types were developed (Table 2.1). While the control group were charged their usual €0.14 per kilowatt hour, the treatment tariffs (A through D) generally involved large price increases during peak day-time hours and reductions for night-time hours to reflect the underlying wholesale cost of electricity at these times (all prices exclude value added tax). The time-of-use price increases/decreases were designed to keep the average household's electricity cost unchanged (peak cost increases to balance with savings off-peak).7 The samples receiving each treatment combination are displayed in [Table 2.2](#page-3-0).

Table 2.1 Time-of-use tariffs (€/kWh) excluding VAT.

|          | Night  | Day    | Peak   |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Tariff A | €0.120 | €0.140 | €0.200 |
| Tariff B | €0.110 | €0.135 | €0.260 |
| Tariff C | €0.100 | €0.130 | €0.320 |
| Tariff D | €0.090 | €0.125 | €0.380 |

The pre- and post-trial surveys explore each household's selfreported stock of information on how to reduce their electricity usage. The informational statements – to which there are five response options from strongly agree ('1') to strongly disagree ('5') – are summarised in [Tables 2.3 and 2.4](#page-3-0). 'K1' explores self-reported information on electricity reducing actions (termed 'general information' henceforth) and asks respondents if 'I know what I need to do in order to reduce electricity usage'. This first statement is unquestionably broad, and the types of information captured by such a question could range from operational (knowing how to adjust appliance controls to save electricity) to behavioural (remembering to switch off appliances when leaving the room) to technical (understanding the energy efficiency technologies available). 'K2' explores the self-reported stock of information about appliance consumption (termed 'appliance information' henceforth) and households were asked to agree/disagree with the statement – 'I do not know enough about how much electricity different appliances use in order to reduce my usage'. These data are used to create two response change categorical variables with three outcomes (bottom of tables): 'moved to disagree', 'no change' and 'moved to agree'. Deteriorations in self-reported information could be the result of confusion or perhaps information overload for some of the trial households.

For K1 [\(Table 2.3](#page-3-0)), the majority (59% for total sample) reports that they have a good understanding of electricity reducing methods (responded with either a '1' or '2'). However, there remains a large proportion of the sample who lie somewhere between 'strongly disagree' and 'neutral'. The positive mean response change of 0.48 implies that households, on average, moved almost half a unit of response in the direction of 'strongly agrees'. Furthermore, there are a large proportion of households stating an improvement (46% compared to 22% deterioration). While this is observed in both the control and treatment groups, the increase is significantly larger in the latter (comparing differences in mean change), particularly so for the IHD

<sup>4</sup> Using available usage data and pre-trial survey responses, an allocation algorithm ensured that each cell (feedback and tariff combination) was approximately the same across a number of behavioural, demographic and attitudinal perspectives. See [CER \(2011b\)](#page-9-0) for further details.

<sup>5</sup> We acknowledge that such generalized information is not'feedback'. This information, however, is auxiliary to consumption feedback, in that it aids households to act upon their specific feedback. However, both 'feedback' and 'generalized information' would both improve what we define as 'knowledge' below.

<sup>6</sup> A third stimulus – an Overall Load Reduction (OLR) – financially rewarded households for meeting a reduction target. This stimulus is excluded from our analysis as the data was unavailable.

<sup>7</sup> A fifth 'weekend' tariff also involved large increases at peak times, but only on weekdays. This treatment was not combined with a feedback stimulus and is therefore not considered.

category, where the percentage of 'strongly agree' responses almost doubled.8

For K2 (Table 2.4), the pre-trial mean response of 2.5 (total sample) indicates that households, in general, consider their lack of information about appliances to be an impediment to their demand reductions (57% agree, 29% disagree and 14% neutral). There is, however, a large improvement (shift towards 'strongly disagree') post-trial, particularly so for the treatment group (mean change in response is −0.39 units for the control group and −0.68 average across all treatment groups). Both are significantly different to zero and the treatment mean is significantly larger than the control. The move towards disagree is particularly large for the IHD group who, on average, show an almost full unit shift in that direction. [Section 4.1](#page-4-0) formalises these preliminary investigations.

To investigate if self-reported changes in the stock of information differed by household type/demographic, data from the pre-trial survey is employed. Six categorical variables, including tenure, building type, age, education, gender and children, are created and Table A.1 (Appendix A) presents their descriptive statistics. Finally, the electricity demand data is collected at half-hourly intervals. This is aggregated for peak, off-peak and total consumption by household and by year (benchmark and trial) and descriptives are presented in Table A.1 (Appendix A).9

#### 3. Methods

A multinomial logit (MNL) model is used to explore if treatment increased the self-reported stock of information about energy efficiency options (research question one). As the model is standard its description is left to Appendix B.10 The MNL model is employed when there is no obvious order in the dependent variable. In this application, the information change variable takes on three values – improvements, no change or deteriorations. Two sets of MNL models are estimated in [Section 4](#page-4-0) below. In the first set ([Section 4.1\)](#page-4-0), each information change variable is regressed upon an overall treatment dummy (all feedback stimuli combined) and then upon the individual feedback stimuli simultaneously (control group the excluded reference category). The second set of models [\(Section 4.2](#page-5-0)) then re-estimate the models of [Section 4.1](#page-4-0) but interact a number of socio-demographic variables with the treatment dummies. MNL models are estimated for each of the six demographic variables separately and results are summarised as marginal effects in [Tables 4.5 and](#page-5-0) [4.6](#page-5-0) for each information change variable respectively.11 The estimation of marginal effects for interaction variables is less straightforward in non-linear models. The approach taken follows the applied methodology presented in [Karaca-Mandic et al. \(2012\)](#page-9-0) and we compare the change in the predicted probability for a one unit change (zero to one) in the categorical demographic variable being analysed (further details/examples provided below in [Section 4.2\)](#page-5-0).

A difference-in-difference (DID) approach is employed to investigate the effects that improvements/deteriorations in the self-reported stock of information may have had on electricity demand (research question two). The DID model can be employed to explore the effects of a policy change when data from two periods (pre and post-policy) and two groups (treated and untreated) are available. The DID model

<sup>10</sup> The model is estimated using STATA version 11.2.

<sup>8</sup> Significance here refers to a simple two-sample mean-comparison t-tests (at a 95% confidence level) comparing the mean change of control and treatment group.

<sup>9</sup> While trial data spans all of 2010, pre-trial (benchmark) data is only available from July 14th, 2009. To avoid seasonal variations in consumption, only data from this date is used for 2010.

<sup>11</sup> Estimating these interactions simultaneously is not possible due to the size of the dataset. The results are summarized as it would not be possible to present full results from the 24 models (six separate demographic interactions by overall treatment and by stimulus for both knowledge statements). Interested readers can, however, contact the corresponding author for the raw results.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>is generally estimated by pooled Ordinary Least Squares and is described by (see [Wooldridge \(2010\),](#page-9-0) for example):

$$
y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y 2_{it} + \beta_2 T_i + \beta_3 Y 2_{it} T_i + u_{it}
$$
 (1)

where yit is electricity demand for household i in period t, Y2 is the period two dummy and T is the treatment dummy (uit the usual noise term). The coefficient β<sup>1</sup> describes the temporal change in demand for the control group and β<sup>2</sup> describes the difference in demand between control and treatment groups in period one. The main coefficient of interest is the interaction term β3, which describes how the demand of the treatment group changed in period two (compared to the control group), or more formally:

$$
\beta_3 = (\overline{y}_{T,Y2} - \overline{y}_{T,Y1}) - (\overline{y}_{C,Y2} - \overline{y}_{C,Y1})
$$
\n(2)

where subscript C represents the control group. The model can also be estimated in a panel data setting by adding a fixed effect (ei) to the error term and using a Within Regression Estimator. However, all time-invariant terms, such as Ti, are swept away by this time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity term and the model then reduces to:

$$
y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y 2_{it} + \beta_3 Y 2_{it} T_i + e_i + u_{it}
$$
(3)

In [Section 4.3](#page-6-0), this model is employed to explore the effects of treatment on electricity demand (for comparison against the original CER reports). [Section 4.4](#page-6-0) then explores if improvements in the selfreported stock of information help explain these reductions by adding further interactions (the information change variables) with each treatment group.

#### 4. Results

4.1. The effects of time-of-use tariffs and associated feedback on the households' self-reported stocks of information

The MNL results and marginal effects of treatment on K1 change (general energy reducing information) are displayed by overall treatment ('TREAT' – all feedback stimuli combined) and by individual feedback in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. [Section 2](#page-1-0) showed that, prior to the trial, almost 60% of the sample felt they had a sufficient understanding of electricity reducing actions (either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement). Results show that trial participation has increased this proxy for the stock of information further, with improvements significantly larger in the treatment groups. Overall (Table 4.1),

the marginal effects demonstrate that treatment significantly increases the probability of improving the stock of information ('moved to agree') by 8.9 percentage points and reduces the probability of lowering the stock of information (move to disagree) by 7.3 percentage points compared to the control group. This effect is highest for the MST and the IHD (Table 4.2), where households are 9.7 and 11.5 percentage points more likely than the control group to show improvements.

A household's self-reported stock of information on appliance consumption is explored in K2. Overall (Table 4.3), treated households are significantly more likely to show an improvement (move to disagree for K2) than the control group. Specifically, the marginal effects demonstrate that trial participation increases the probability of an improvement by 7.5 percentage points and lowers the probability of a deterioration by 3.9 percentage points. [Table 4.4](#page-5-0) again shows the IHD to be the most important stimulus for improving the stock of information (BI-MST not significant here) and households who received the treatment are 13.5 percentage points more likely to show an improvement than the control group.

In summary, there is strong evidence that time-of-use tariffs and increased levels of feedback increase a household's self-reported stocks of both general and appliance-related information on efficiency options. In both cases, receiving the IHD has the strongest effect, followed by the MST and BI-MST respectively (the latter not significant for K2). This is consistent with the amount of 'feedback' that each stimulus contains.

#### 4.2. Socio-demographic interactions

Tables 4.5 and 4.6 present the marginal effects of feedback for a number of socio-demographic indicators.12 The last column of these tables describes the overall treatment effect for each demographic, while columns one through three show the effect by feedback stimulus. Each marginal effect gives the percentage point change in probability for a zero-one change in the categorical demographic relative to the reference group (the excluded category within the demographic variable being explored). To illustrate, in Table 4.5, the marginal effect of TENURE1 at BI-MST on 'moved to disagree' is −0.13 which implies that renters who received this stimulus are less likely to show a deterioration (decreases the probability by 13 percentage points) than non-renters (households who own outright or have a mortgage). This is, however, the only significant effect for tenure and, in general, renters did not respond any different to treatment. The house-type interactions show similar results with apartment dwellers responding no differently to overall treatment or to each individual stimulus (than nonapartment dwellers). The age categories are significant at BI-MST (also overall for the oldest age category) where the results demonstrate that younger households (18–35 years; the base category) are 17 percentage points more likely than AGE2 (36–55 years) and 12 percentage points more likely than AGE3 (55+ years) to improve their self-reported stock of general information on how to reduce consumption.<sup>13</sup> The presence of children is significant (overall) –

<sup>12</sup> Tables 4.5 and 4.6 display the marginal effect and the statistical significance indicator only. These tables summarize the results from twelve separate regressions and it is therefore not possible to display the full results.

<sup>13</sup> The effects of the two age categories are estimated simultaneously. The reference group is therefore AGE1 (young households).

households without children are 5.3 percentage points more likely to show a deterioration. Finally, the interaction of gender and education demonstrates that being female increases the probability of a 'no change' while households with a third level education are significantly more likely to show an improvement (4.4 percentage point increase, overall).

The interacted marginal effects for K2 (appliance information) are displayed in [Table 4.6](#page-5-0) and show a small number of significant effects. Renting households display a negative treatment effect at 'moved to disagree' (overall). This therefore implies that non-renters are more likely to show an improvement in the stock of appliance information than renters (probability of a move to disagree 9.3 percentage points higher). In this regard, the MST appears to be particularly valuable to non-renters, who are over 15.2 percentage points more likely to show an improvement. While age and the presence of children show no significant effects, households headed by females are more likely (4.2 percentage points) to show an improvement, overall. For education, it is possible that third-level households benefited from the IHD, but only in that they are significantly less likely to show a deterioration (reduces the probability of a deterioration by 6 percentage points).

#### 4.3. The effects of treatment on demand

Table 4.7 displays the effect of each stimulus on total, peak and off-peak demand using the DID model. Table 4.8 summarises these effects as percentage changes. The coefficient for Y2 (2010 dummy variable) describes the change in demand for the control group between the benchmark period (2009) and the treatment period (2010), and is not significant, as expected. The main variables of interest are the interaction terms which describe the difference in 2010 demand for each feedback stimuli (compared to the control group), and it is evident that treatment has significantly reduced total demand in 2010.<sup>14</sup> For example, the MST has the largest effect and has lowered total demand by 60.33 kWh or by 2.9% (versus control group levels in the treatment year). This is followed by the IHD and BI-MST (the latter not significant), which show reductions of 43.03 kWh (2.1%) and 7.13 kWh (0.4%) respectively. Overall (all feedback groups combined), treatment has significantly lowered total demand by 36.95 kWh (1.8%).15 Subsequent auxiliary regressions (not displayed) also show that these feedback-led reductions differ by a household's appliance composition (interacting feedback stimuli with appliance dummies). For example, households

Percentage reductions in treatment groups.

|        | Total     | Peak      | Off-peak |

| MST    | -2.949*** | -8.746*** | -2.025*  |
| IHD    | -2.103**  | -9.456*** | -0.932   |

Note: Reductions are relative to the control group demand levels in the treatment year.

with high-consuming devices, such as electric immersion heaters (77% of the sample) and storage heaters (4%), show larger reductions than households without.<sup>16</sup> However, this is perhaps expected as households without such items have significantly lower electricity demand and thus less capacity to reduce.

Peak reductions are relatively higher, and treatment is significant both overall and by feedback type. The average peak reduction is 7.8%, and this is strongest for the IHD (9.4%), followed by the MST (8.7%) and the BI-MST (5.4%). Furthermore, the majority of the total demand reductions occurred during peak times – overall, 59% of total reductions occurring during this two hour period. This dominant peak effect is also supported by the lack of significance at off-peak times, both overall and by stimulus, in all but the MST.

## 4.4. The effects of changes in the self-reported stock of information on demand

The previous section has shown a significant reduction in total and peak demand as a direct result of treatment. Using the same DID methodology, this section explores if this decrease can be explained by an improvement in a household's self-reported stock of information (Research Question Two). The results in [Table 4.9](#page-7-0) show the effects of a change in K1 (general information) on total, peak and off-peak demand. Between pre and post-surveys, 48% of households (treated) showed an improvement in their general information, 20% showed a deterioration and 32% did not change their response. This information-change categorical variable has been disaggregated into five groups to investigate the consistency of the correlations – a large improvement, for example, should, if relevant, lead to a larger decrease in demand than a small improvement.<sup>17</sup>

The 2010 dummy, in this setting, describes the change in demand for control households that showed no improvement or deterioration in their self-reported general information (the excluded reference group for the informational change dummy variables). These households increased their total demand by 49.47 kWh (compared to 2009). The stimuli interactions show how this differed for treated households (again, for those who kept their response unchanged).<sup>18</sup> The three-way interactions then show if treated households reporting informational improvements/deteriorations reduced significantly more/less. In this regard, there are few significant effects, and where significant, the coefficients are not of the expected sign. For example, for the MST and IHD, households with large improvements ('large move to agree') have significantly higher total demand in 2010 than households who kept their response unchanged

<sup>14</sup> We have not included additional tariff interactions as the subgroups would no longer be representative. The trial was designed to be representative at the stimuli level and also at the tariff level only.

<sup>15</sup> Model results for the overall effect are not shown, but are estimated using the same methodology but replacing the individual feedback dummy variables with the single overall treatment dummy (TREAT).

<sup>16</sup> These secondary results, while certainly of a general interest, extend beyond our core research questions. To maintain clarity, therefore, we have not included these extra tables of results. Interested readers can, however, contact the corresponding author for details.

<sup>17</sup> For the knowledge change variables a 'large move' indicates a 3 or 4 unit shift in response and a 'small move' indicates a 1 or 2 unit shift. For example, if a household responded with a 1 in the pre-trial survey and a 4 in the post-trial survey, their change of −3 would be represented as a 'large move to disagree'.

<sup>18</sup> Although these appear considerably larger than Section 4.3, the net effect [Y2 + (Y2 \* TREATMENT)] is closer to Table 4.8.

(higher even than households who showed a deterioration). Furthermore, peak and off-peak, improvements, large or small, do not accompany significantly larger reductions and, again, in most cases, the signs even suggest the opposite. Table 4.10 shows the effect of appliance information change (K2) on demand. As with K1, there are few significant three-way interaction effects and the direction of the relationship is inconsistent with expectations. In only a number of cases – for example, households with the MST and small improvements ('small move to disagree') – is the sign of the coefficient as expected (but, again, is not significant).

<span id="page-8-0"></span>These results appear to be robust to a household's endowment of appliances (not shown). For example, interacting the self-reported information variables with appliance dummies (estimated separately for immersion and storage heaters) does not change this general result.<sup>19</sup> Furthermore, if we exclude households who started with a high initial stock of information from the analysis (households that could not improve) our conclusions, in general, do not change.20

#### 5. Discussion

This paper attempts to gain a deeper understanding of demand reductions by exploring the role of increasing a household's stock of information about energy use and efficiency options through improved feedback on electricity use and exposure to time-of-use tariffs. Understanding the mechanisms of behavioural change is important for formulating policy, in particular policy that has an informational component. Three main findings are apparent. First, consistent with the original [\(CER, 2011c](#page-9-0)) findings, treatment has lowered demand, and in 2010, total demand is 1.8% lower than the control group. Regarding the effects of different types of feedback, households who received the monthly user statement made the largest reductions (2.9%) followed by the in-house display (2.1%) and the bimonthly user statement (0.3% – not significant). These reductions, while generally significant, are certainly at the lower end of trial findings internationally (particularly studies that combine time-of-use and feedback), where total demand reductions are estimated to range anywhere between zero and 14%. Secondly, treatment has led to significant improvements in stocks of information reported by households on both general and appliance-related options for conserving electricity– while the control group also showed improvements, the gains for the treatment sample (overall) are significantly higher, particularly for households receiving the in-house display, which increased the probability of information gains by 11.5 and 13.9 percentage points (general and appliance respectively) relative to the control group.

Our last set of models shows no statistically significant relationship between changes in the self-reported stock of information on conservation options and in demand for electricity – in general, the results were neither significant nor consistent with expectations. During the trial a large proportion of the sample increased their self-assessed stock of information about how to reduce electricity consumption. Overall, 48% of treated households showed improved levels of general information (35% small improvement and 11% large improvement) and 51% reported improved appliance-related information (32% small and 18% large). However, our results imply that these improvements had no significant association with the observed demand reductions and imply, for example, that the 19% of households who reported a large improvement in their appliance-related information did not reduce their electricity consumption more than households who kept their response unchanged (25% of the sample). In most cases, the signs even suggest the opposite.

Policymakers need be aware of the mechanisms by which feedback and information reduce energy demand. Feedback on energy use may make energy use more visible and provide a better understanding of what appliances and behaviours consume the most, and when. Thus it may serve to address an existing market failure brought about by imperfect information. However, our results suggest that reductions in demand following introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs were not brought about by an improvement in the stock of such information, or at least the component of information correlated with the self-reported proxies available to us. In summary, we found no evidence that these informational improvements per se were necessary or sufficient for reducing electricity demand.

However, and crucial for policy formulation, is that these results do not indicate that feedback and time-of-use tariffs are ineffective at reducing or shifting demand, but only that they reduce demand through some other mechanism. The results suggest that frameworks which go beyond addressing imperfect information are justified. [Allcott \(2011\),](#page-9-0) for example, suggests that many energy reducing actions, such as turning off lights, adjusting thermostats and closing blinds, are likely to be behaviours that most households are aware of already, and that feedback/information drives reductions by drawing attention to or increasing the 'moral cost' of energy use (pg. 1088).21 It is also possible that increased feedback simply increases the frequency of reminders, which then increases a household's motivation to reach its conservation targets (see [MIT \(2011\)](#page-9-0) pg. 162 and [Faruqui et al. \(2010\)](#page-9-0) pg. 1607). The real-time feedback provided by IHDs may also increase a household's sense of control and increase the rewards associated with conservation efforts. This motivational component of behavioural change has also been discussed by [Gram-Hanssen \(2010\)](#page-9-0). The insignificant demandreducing effects of the bimonthly user statement versus the significant effects of the monthly (same information but more frequent) supports this possibility. Furthermore, in the demand response literature, [Faruqui and Sergici \(2011\)](#page-9-0) show how a pure reminder (The Energy Orb) facilitates significantly larger peak reductions.

It is important to highlight that our results only relate to a short-run experiment – during our twelve months of data, the technologies and efficiency levels within the majority of households are fixed, particularly so for very high consumption items such as cookers, immersions and heating systems which get replaced over much longer timeframes. Over such durations, increased awareness of appliance consumption would likely motivate more efficient appliance purchases and renovation decisions, and the effects of such may outweigh any of the short-run motivation-led reductions (assuming this is the driver in the short-run). If this is the case, the appropriate policy is then to provide frequent reminders to increase a household's motivation in the short-run, but to maintain an educational component to facilitate knowledge-led reductions in the long-run. The likelihood of the latter, however, remains the work of future research using data from longer panels.

Finally, the extensive research of [Ofgem \(2011\)](#page-9-0) also highlights a potential issue in smart metering trials which may bias the true effects of feedback. Their findings suggest that the physical presence of the meter is important, and that feedback – including an in-house display, energy efficiency information, historic feedback and financial incentives – in the absence of a smart meter has no effect. Of particular interest, is that when the meter is installed as a 'routine replacement' and its presence not communicated effectively to the household (in trials testing in-house displays) there is also no significant effect. It is possible that in the contemporary world of desirable 'smart' consumer products, the actual labelling of the meter may have increased a household's engagement, motivation and subsequent utilisation of informational aids. The overall potential for smart metering will therefore rest heavily on how customers are engaged and encouraged to incorporate this technology into their day-to-day behaviours [\(Darby, 2010b](#page-9-0)).

#### 6. Conclusion

Smart metering trials in Ireland and internationally have identified significant societal benefits. International findings, while varying in magnitude, generally show that a combination of time-of-use tariffs

<sup>19</sup> We test this as households without these high-consumption items may 'feel' their knowledge has increased but, without these items, may have no capacity to make sizable reductions. Given the small sample size, we avoided a fourth interaction and tested this hypothesis on treated households only (exclude the control group). These tests are not shown but are available on request from the corresponding author.

<sup>20</sup> With one exception for appliance knowledge (out of twelve knowledge-feedback interactions) – households with the MST who made a 'small move to disagree' (a small improvement) had significantly lower off-peak demand in the reduced sample. This is, however, clearly an isolated result among many tests.

<sup>21</sup> Behavioural changes observed following the comparative feedback and generalized information provided though OPOWERS's Home Energy Reports in the USA.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>and increased customer feedback can yield reductions in demand, particularly at peak times, and a large-scale roll-out of smart meters would lead to lower and smoother load profiles and significant reductions in CO2. For Ireland, (CER, 2011b) explores the costs and benefits (for networks, suppliers, generators and end-users) of alternative smart metering technologies and levels of feedback, and conclude that the national roll-out of smart meters would bring statistically significant and economically substantial net benefits.22

This paper has attempted to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions. Consistent with (CER, 2011c), our results show that smart metering supported by increased customer feedback helped residential customers to reduce their electricity demand. We also find that treated households increased their selfreported stock of energy-reducing information. We do not, however, find a correlation between self-reported information improvements and demand reductions. This final result does not support the hypothesis that imperfect information pre-metering (related to energy reducing actions and appliance consumption, as defined) was leading to over-consumption. It is possible then that smart-metering is effective because it acts as a reminder and motivator, rather than an educational aid.

There are, however, a number of limitations to our data. As the trial simultaneously applied time-of-use tariffs and various levels of feedback in combination, it is not possible to isolate the presence of a pure feedback-led 'conservation' effect. Although relative peak reductions are higher and suggest that the tariffs are the main behavioural driver, peak to off-peak load-shifting would have lowered a 'pure' conservation effect during off-peak times. A further limitation of the data is the reliability of our proxies for the stock of information, which are self-reported and therefore subject to measurement error. The possibility of this bias could be removed if future trials included tests of the actual information possessed by participants. Furthermore, the size of our dataset limits deeper levels of knowledge interactions which could provide further insight. For example, although large improvements in information stocks were not significant, it would be interesting to explore if households with low initial stocks of information and subsequent large improvements also showed no reduction in demand.

<sup>22</sup> The authors calculate the net present value of a roll-out, and state that their estimates are likely to be conservative and be at the lower end of expected benefits. They find that bimonthly billing without the IHD generally provides the highest net present value (but including the IHD only reduces the NPV marginally in most cases). Results are, however, quite sensitive to the tariff rates chosen.
